  <title>Underway fCO2 measurements from the 2011 West Coast Ocean Acidification Cruise (WCOA2011) aboard the R/V Wecoma</title>
  <abstract>This cruise represents the first dedicated West Coast Ocean Acidification cruise, which took place August 12-30, 2011 aboard the R/V Wecoma.  Ninety-five stations were occupied from northern Washington to southern California along thirteen transect lines.  At all stations, CTD casts were conducted, and discrete water samples were collected in Niskin bottles.  Underway measurements of pCO2 were collected during the duration of the cruise.  The cruise was designed to obtain a synoptic snapshot of key carbon, physical, and biogeochemical parameters as they relate to ocean acidification (OA) in the coastal realm. During the cruise, some of the same transect lines were occupied as during the 2007 West Coast Carbon cruise, as well as many CalCOFI stations. This effort was conducted in support of the coastal monitoring and research objectives of the NOAA Ocean Acidification Program (OAP).</abstract>
  <purpose>The major objectives of the cruise were:
1) To characterize ocean acidification (OA) conditions on the U.S. West Coast;
2) To conduct inter-calibration measurements near other OA observing assets, including gliders and moorings, in the study area, allowing inter-calibration of these autonomous assets with high-quality, ship-based measurements;
3) To provide calibration data needed to develop predictive models for aragonite saturation state, pH, and other important OA indicators in the California Current System, based on widely measured parameters such as salinity, temperature, and oxygen concentration;
4) To examine relationships between processes leading to OA and hypoxia in coastal ecosystems;
5) To conduct biological measurements in conjunction with physical and chemical OA measurements; and
6) To provide scientific information on OA conditions and trends for resource management and decision support.</purpose>

    <standardization>
      <description>The system runs a full cycle in approximately 5 hours.  The cycle starts with 4 standard gases, then measures 90 surface water samples interspersed with 5 atmospheric samples every 30 minutes.  Each new gas is flushed through the Licor Analyzer for 4 minutes prior to a 10 second reading from the analyzer during which the sample cell is open to the atmosphere.  Subsequent samples of the same gas are flushed through the Licor Analyzer for 30 seconds prior to a stop-flow measurement.</description>
