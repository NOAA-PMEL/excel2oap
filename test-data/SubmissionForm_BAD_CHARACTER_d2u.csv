31,Title,National Coral Reef Monitoring Program - Ocean Acidification Enterprise 2019,5
32,Abstract,"This archival package contains carbonate chemistry data collected at both random locations and existing long-term sites in the Florida Keys and Southeast Florida as part of the NOAA National Coral Reef Monitoring Program (NCRMP). These data are collected and analyzed to assess spatial and temporal variation in the seawater carbonate systems of coral reef ecosystems and include two types of sampling methods. The first method is collected by hand at the surface, either from the boat or by SCUBA divers. The second method uses subsurface autosamplers where water samples provided in this dataset were collected at a depth of 15m. Samples are either collected singularly or as part of a diurnal set. The samples are processed by the Atlantic Oceanographic Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) where they are analyzed for total alkalinity (TA), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and Spectrophotometric pH. Using the analyzed TA and DIC, alongside temperature, salinity and depth data, AOML staff calculated other important carbonate chemistry system parameters such as pH, pCO2, and aragonite saturation and reported the results in this dataset.",6
33,Purpose,"Provide high-quality carbonate chemistry data (dissolved inorganic carbonand total alkalinity) for US coral reef areas at a several spatial and temporal scales, in close partnership with the larger CRCP NCRMP and OAP/PMEL NOA-ON efforts.",7
