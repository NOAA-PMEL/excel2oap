    <title>Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA) collected from discrete sample and profile observations from HEALY in the Bering and Chukchi Sea along transect lines in the Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO) from 2019-08-06 to 2019-08-22.  Water temperature, salinity, oxygen, and nutrients are included for the same depths and locations.</title>
    <abstract>This carbon data set includes chemical data from discrete samples and physical data from a profiling CTD collected on USCGC HEALY cruise 1901.  Data was collected in the Bering and Chukchi Sea along transect lines in the Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO) areas DB01, 03, 04, and 05 from 2019-08-06 to 2019-08-22. These data include WATER CTD TEMPERATURE, CTD SALINITY, DISSOLVED INORGANIC CARBON (DIC), TOTAL ALKALINITY (TA), CTD Dissolved OXYGEN, and nurients (Nitrate, Nitrite, Phosphate, Silicate, and Ammonium). The cruise was funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminitration (NOAA) Arctic Research Program (ARP) and supported by numerous agencies and institutions including the Natiional Science Foundation (NSF). The carbon data were collected by Jessica Cross of the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) and run using equipment from the Ocean Acidification Research Center (OARC) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF).  Cross was funded by NOAA's Arctic Research Program and Monacci was funded by the Alaska Ocean Observing System . The CTD operations on the cruise were managed by personnel from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Research Institute (WHOI).  Nutrient data were analyzed by Calvin Mordy at the University of Washington Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere (JISAO).  Mordy was funded by the Ecosystems Fisheries Oceanography Coordinated Investigations (EcoFOCI) Program and NOAA's ARP.  Phyllis Stabeno is co-Principal Investigator of the EcoFOCI program.</abstract>
    <purpose>The Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO) is envisioned as a change detection array along a latitudinal gradient extending from the northern Bering Sea to the Barrow Arc. DBO sampling is focused on transects centered on locations of high productivity, biodiversity and rates of biological change.</purpose>
