32,Abstract,"This UW PRISM Puget Sound cruise took place from 02/04/2008 to 02/08/2008 aboard the R/V Thomas G. Thompson.  42 time-series stations were occupied in the Salish Sea in Washington State marine waters.  The cruise was designed to obtain a synoptic snapshot of key carbon, physical, and other biogeochemical parameters as they relate to ocean acidification (OA) in Washington's estuarine and coastal environments.  At all sampling stations, CTD casts were conducted to measure temperature, conductivity, pressure, and oxygen concentrations using CTD and oxygen sensors. Discrete water samples were collected throughout the water column at all stations in Niskin bottles.  Laboratory analyses were run to measure dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), oxygen, and nutrient concentrations and total alkalinity.  More information--including a map of stations occupied during this cruise (and other Salish cruises), full-resolution CTD downcast data for all stations sampled, chlorophyll and phaeopigment concentrations, and other sensor data--can be found at nvs.nanoos.org/CruiseSalish by exploring the Map, Data, and Plots tabs. This effort was conducted in support of the estuarine and coastal monitoring and research objectives of the UW PRISM program and conforms to monitoring guidelines of the Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network (goa-on.org) and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Ocean Acidification Program.  The official R/V Thomas G. Thompson code for this cruise is TN216.  

Data Use Policy: Data from UW/PRISM/NANOOS/WOAC/NOAA/PMEL cruises in Washington waters (hereafter “Salish cruises”) are made freely available to the public and the scientific community in the belief that their wide dissemination will lead to greater understanding and new scientific and policy insights. The availability of these data does not constitute publication of the data or permission to use the data, or information contained in them, for publication or commercial use.  The investigators sharing these data rely on the ethics and integrity of the user to ensure that the institutions and investigators involved in producing Salish cruises data sets receive fair credit for their work.  If the data are obtained for potential use in a publication or presentation, the investigators should be informed at the outset of the nature of this work. If these data are essential to the work, or if an important result or conclusion depends on these data, co-authorship may be appropriate.  This should be discussed at an early stage in the work.  Manuscripts using these data should be sent to all investigators listed in the metadata for review before they are submitted for publication so that we can ensure that the quality and limitations of the data are accurately represented.  ",6,"Jan - I tried to make this as generalized as possible to make metadata preparation both accurate for a given cruise and easy to propagate.  

Also, I modeled the Data Use Policy statement after some I found on NOAA/ESRL's atmospheric CO2 and NASA's Megacities Project web sites.","See red text.  Some info on ""Julian - README"" tab in case not self-explanatory.",,,,,,,,,,,,
33,Purpose,"The major objectives of the cruise were:
1) To characterize ocean acidification (OA) conditions in the Salish Sea and adjoining coastal waters;
2) To conduct inter-calibration measurements near other OA observing assets, including moorings, in the study area, allowing inter-calibration of these autonomous assets with high-quality, ship-based measurements;
3) To provide calibration data needed to develop and validate predictive models for aragonite saturation state, pH, and other important OA indicators in the Salish Sea and adjoining coastal waters, based on widely measured parameters such as salinity, temperature, and oxygen concentration;
4) To examine relationships between processes leading to OA and hypoxia in estuarine and coastal ecosystems;
5) To conduct biological measurements in conjunction with physical and chemical OA measurements; and
6) To provide scientific information on OA conditions and trends for resource management and decision support.",7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(CAB1034 FHL did all but bio stations, also one TN cruise) - at least two, maybe three different DIC systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,DIC: Detailed sampling and analyzing information,"PLEASE NOTE: DIC may be referred to as TCO2, TCARBN, or C(sub)T in other data sets.  All of these abbreviations refer to the total dissolved inorganic carbon concentration (i.e., the combined concentration of dissolved CO2, bicarbonate ion, and carbonate ion).

Samples for DIC measurements were drawn according to procedures outlined in the 2007 PICES Special Publication, Guide to Best Practices for Ocean CO2 Measurements, from Niskin bottles into ~0.5 L borosilicate glass flasks using silicone tubing. The flasks were rinsed once and filled from the bottom with care not to entrain any bubbles, overflowing by at least one-half volume. The sample tube was pinched off and withdrawn, creating a small headspace, and 0.2 mL of saturated HgCl2 solution was added as a preservative. The sample bottles were then sealed with glass stoppers lightly covered with Apiezon-L grease. DIC samples were collected from variety of depths with approximately 10% of these samples taken as duplicates.  Sample bottles were inverted several times to ensure mixing of the HgCl2 throughout the sample.

The accuracy of the DICE measurement is determined with the use of standards (Certified Reference Materials (CRMs), consisting of filtered and UV-irradiated seawater) supplied by Dr. Andrew Dickson of Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO). The CRM accuracy is determined manometrically on land in San Diego. DIC data reported to the Ocean Carbon and Acidification Data Portal have been corrected to the appropriate certified batch value.  Sample seawater from XXXX Niskin bottles was analyzed for DIC for this cruise.",22.10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78,DIC: Field replicate information,"Duplicate samples were collected from approximately 10% of the Niskins sampled, as a check of our precision.  These replicate samples were interspersed throughout the station analysis for quality assurance and integrity of the coulometer cell solutions.

79,DIC: Standardization technique description,"Each coulometer was calibrated by injecting aliquots of pure CO2 (99.999%) by means of an 8-port valve (Wilke et al., 1993) outfitted with two calibrated sample loops of different sizes (~1ml and ~2ml). The instruments were each separately calibrated at the beginning of each cell with a minimum of two sets of these gas loop injections and then again at the end of each cell to ensure no drift during the life of the cell.

103,TA: Detailed sampling and analyzing information,"Seawater total alkalinity (TA) was measured by acidimetric titration.  The specific method used was based upon the open-cell method described by Dickson et al (2003). This method involves first acidifying the sample to reduce the sample pH of just over 3.5 followed by bubbling CO2-free air through the sample to facilitate removal of the CO2 evolved by the acid addition.  After removal of the carbonate species from solution, the titration proceeds until a pH of just below 3.0 is attained, and the equivalence point evaluated from titration points in the pH region 3.0–3.5 using a non-linear least squares procedure that corrects for the reactions with sulfate and fluoride ions (Dickson et al. 2003).  Titration progress is monitored by measuring the electromotive force (E) of a combination glass-reference electrode.
Samples were drawn from the Niskin-type bottles into cleaned 250-ml borosilicate glass bottles using Tygon tubing with silicone ends.  Bottles were rinsed twice and filled from the bottom, overflowing half a volume and taking care not to entrain any bubbles.  The sample tube was closed off and withdrawn from the sample bottle, creating a 5 ml headspace.  Samples were preserved by poisoning with 0.12 ml of a saturated HgCl2 solution.  Sample bottles were sealed with glass stoppers lightly coated with Apiezon-L grease, and were stored at room temperature (21-25 °C) for a maximum of 12 hours prior to analysis. 
Titrations were carried out in water-jacketed, 250-ml beakers.  The beakers were kept at 24.0 ± 0.2 °C with water from a constant temperature bath.   Prior to analysis, samples were placed in the water bath to bring them to the same temperature as the reaction beakers.  Seawater samples were dispensed into the water-jacketed beaker using a fixed-volume glass syringe. A Metrohm Dosimat 765 was used to deliver acid to the sample beaker in increments of 0.040 ml.  The acid titrant used was 0.1 mol/kg HCl prepared in 0.6 mol/kg NaCl background to approximate the ionic strength of seawater (0.7 mol/kg).  
Instrument control and data acquisition was with custom software developed in Andrew Dickson's laboratory at Scripps Institution of Oceanography and modified by a former employee of the NOAA/PMEL Carbon Group using the National Instruments LabView programming environment. Typical titrations were completed in 10-14 minutes and required 20-24 acid additions to reach a pH of 3.0. 838 values were reported to the database.",23.13,,Please make sure this info is all correct as applied to the new systems.,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the filter re-attached, about 5 mL of of sample water was filtered into sample bottle to rinse and then discarded.  45-50 mL of sample was filtered into sample bottle, such that it was less than 2/3 full.  The cap was secured and the bottle frozen upright in a -10 degree Celsius freezer until analyzed.  Analyses and calibration followed the protocols of the WOCE Hydrographic Program using a Seal Analytical AA3 (UNESCO 1994).",27.13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

417,Var11: Calculation method and parameters,"First, all CTD and bottle dissolved oxygen (O2) data were converted from original units (typically milligrams O2 per liter seawater [mg/L] but occasionally milliliters O2 per liter seawater [mL/L]) to micromoles O2 per kilogram of seawater (hereafter umol/kg).

In cases where CTD oxygen data were provided in mL/L, we converted them to mg/L for consistency in the submitted data set using this conversion:
(O2 in mg/L) = (O2 in mL/L) / 1.42903

To convert from units of mg/L to umol/kg, we used the potential density (= [1000 + sigma theta], which is “the density calculated with in situ salinity, potential temperature, and pressure = 0, minus 1000 kg/m^3” as in http://www.oc.nps.edu/nom/day1/parta.html).  The potential density is hereafter abbreviated as rhoTheta.

Corrections were done as follows (Garcia and Gordon, 1992):
(O2 in umol/kg) = ((O2 in mg/L) x 44.6596 x 1000)/(rhoTheta x 1.42903)

We note that Garcia and Gordon use rhoTheta in units of kg/L, hence the conversion factor of 1000 in our equations above.

Next, the converted CTD and bottle O2 data (i.e., Var9 and Var10, after conversion to umol/kg units, we refer to as CTD_O2 and BOT_O2) were plotted together, with CTD_O2 on the x-axis and BOT_O2 on the y-axis.  We eliminated strong outliers after close inspection of each outlying data point in the context of the depth profiles at each station.  With the remaining data points, we generated a linear regression equation and used this relationship to correct the CTD_O2 data for the offset and slope differences from BOT_O2 values.  In other words, while we had bottle O2 data for only a subset of all Niskin bottle samples, we generated the bottle-O2-equivalent value for ALL samples by applying the regression relationship to the uncorrected but unit-converted CTD_O2 data. Thus, CTD_OXY_corr_umol_kg is the corrected CTD oxygen value, in units of umol/kg.

The equations used for specific cruises are included below:
Feb 2008 cruise: CTD_OXY_corr_umol_kg (= BOT_O2) = 1.0218 x CTD_O2 + 1.8714
Aug 2008 cruise: CTD_OXY_corr_umol_kg (= BOT_O2) = 0.9176 x CTD_O2 + 5.6326
Sept 2009 cruise: CTD_OXY_corr_umol_kg (= BOT_O2) = 0.9968 x CTD_O2 + 12.058
Oct 2010 cruise: CTD_OXY_corr_umol_kg (= BOT_O2) = 1.0408 x CTD_O2 - 0.1491
Oct 2011 cruise: CTD_OXY_corr_umol_kg (= BOT_O2) = 1.1068 x CTD_O2 - 1.0869
